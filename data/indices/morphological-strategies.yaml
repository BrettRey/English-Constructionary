  suppletion:
    description: "Paradigm cells filled by phonologically unrelated stems rather than regular derivation."
    characteristics:
      - "Stems share no phonological resemblance"
      - "Paradigmatic link is stored, not computed"
      - "Typically high-frequency items"
      - "Blocks regular formation (*goed, *gooder)"
    examples:
      - "go/went"
      - "good/better/best"
      - "be/am/is/are/was/were"
      - "first, second, third (ordinals of one, two, three)"
      - "once, twice (multiplicatives)"
      - "eleven, twelve (teens)"
    notes:
      - "Stabilised by token frequency and early acquisition"
      - "Cross-linguistically common in high-frequency paradigms"
  affixation:
    description: "Word formation by adding bound morphemes to a base."
    subtypes:
      - suffixation
      - prefixation
      - infixation
  suffixation:
    description: "Affixation at the right edge of the base."
    examples:
      - "-s (plural)"
      - "-ed (past tense)"
      - "-th (ordinal)"
      - "-er (comparative)"
  prefixation:
    description: "Affixation at the left edge of the base."
    examples:
      - "un- (negation)"
      - "re- (repetition)"
      - "pre- (temporal)"
  ablaut:
    description: "Vowel alternation signalling morphological distinction."
    examples:
      - "sing/sang/sung"
      - "foot/feet"
      - "man/men"
    notes:
      - "Also called apophony or vowel gradation"
  conversion:
    description: "Category change without overt morphological marking."
    examples:
      - "water (N) → water (V)"
      - "clean (Adj) → clean (V)"
    notes:
      - "Also called zero-derivation"
  compounding:
    description: "Word formation by combining two or more free morphemes."
    examples:
      - "blackbird"
      - "twenty-one"
      - "ice cream"
  reduplication:
    description: "Word formation by copying all or part of the base."
    examples:
      - "goody-goody"
      - "teeny-weeny"
    notes:
      - "Limited productivity in English; more common in other languages"
