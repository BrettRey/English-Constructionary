meanings:
  - meaning: "Generic/kind reference"
    examples:
      - form: "dogs bark"

      - form: "coffee is a stimulant"
        notes: "General statement about coffee as a substance"

      Bare plurals and mass nouns can also contribute to habitual or dispositional
      readings when combined with verbs that express habitual actions (e.g., 'drinks',
      'eats', 'smokes') and when the overall context supports such an interpretation.
      For example, 'John drinks beer' can be interpreted as a statement about John's
      habitual behavior. However, this habitual meaning is not solely due to the bare
      NP construction but arises from the interaction of the bare NP with the verb
      and the context.
  - meaning: "Indefinite reference (often with plural or mass nouns)"

      - form: "There's coffee on the table."
        notes: "Refers to an unspecified amount of coffee"
  - meaning: "Incorporated/Institutionalized"

      These are often fixed expressions with specialized meanings, particularly common
      with singular bare NPs in specific contexts (e.g., 'go to', 'be in/at'). They
      often refer to an institution or a general activity rather than a specific
      physical place.
  - meaning: "Abstract/Figurative"
    examples:
      - form: "Love conquers all."
        notes: "Abstract concept used in a proverb"
      - form: "Time is money."
        notes: "Figurative use of 'time' and 'money'"
    notes: |
      Bare NPs can be used in abstract or figurative expressions, often in proverbs,
      sayings, or literary language. The specific interpretation often depends heavily
      on the idiom or the broader context.
