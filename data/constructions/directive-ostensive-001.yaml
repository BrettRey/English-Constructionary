id: directive-ostensive-001
name: Directive-Ostensive Construction
pattern: NP[directive-ostensive]
type: syntactic
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Alerts addressee to attend to referent in shared environment
    details: Directs addressee's attention to something present or imminent. Ostensive in the Sperber & Wilson sense - showing rather than describing. Typically exclamatory intonation with fall or rise-fall. Not syntactically integrated as a clause argument. Normal NP determination applies.
    examples:
      - form: "[The robbers]!"
        note: Definite, alerting to threat
      - form: "[Robbers]!"
        note: Bare plural
      - form: "[A snake]!"
        note: Indefinite singular count (determiner required)
      - form: "[That man]!"
        note: Demonstrative, pointing out
      - form: "[Your keys]!"
        note: 2nd-person genitive, reminding
      - form: "[Fire]!"
        note: Bare mass noun
      - form: "[The bus]!"
        note: Definite, alerting to imminent departure
constraints:
  - type: syntactic
    description: Normal NP determination (singular count nouns require a determiner; mass and plural can be bare)
  - type: pragmatic
    description: Referent must be present or imminent in shared environment
  - type: structural
    description: Exclamatory intonation, typically fall or rise-fall
  - type: semantic
    description: Referent is NOT the addressee (distinguishes from vocative)
relations:
  '1':
    construction: vocative-001
    type: related-to
    notes: Both are non-argumental NPs with directive function; vocative addresses hearer, directive-ostensive alerts hearer to something else
relatedConstructions:
  - id: vocative-001
    relationship: alternates-with
    notes: Both direct attention but differ in target (addressee vs. environment)
