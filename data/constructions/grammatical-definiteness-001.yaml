id: grammatical-definiteness-001
name: Grammatical Definiteness
pattern: Semantic feature implemented through nominal determination
type: semantic
dimensions:
  form: "Typically realized by deital determiners (the, this, that, possessives) or bare proper nouns"
  meaning: "Identifiability, uniqueness, discourse familiarity"
  function: "Establishes referent accessibility; anchors information structure"
  distribution: "NPs in argument and predicative positions"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Identifiability status
    details: Whether entity can be uniquely identified in context
    examples:
      - form: the/a cat
        note: Identifiable vs non-identifiable
      - form: John/some person
        note: Inherent vs non-identifiable
  '2':
    definition: Reference scope
    details: Whether reference exhausts contextual set
    examples:
      - form: every/some students
        note: Maximal vs partial
      - form: the/a winner
        note: Unique vs arbitrary
  '3':
