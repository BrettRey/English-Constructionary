id: determination-001
name: Determination
pattern: "Determiner function in NP"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Licenses a nominal as an NP and marks it for definiteness or indefiniteness
    details: Realized by basic determiners (determinatives), subject-determiners (genitive NPs), and a limited set of minor determiners (plain-case NPs or PPs).
    examples:
      - form: "the new car"
        note: Determinative realization; definite
      - form: "one new car"
        note: Determinative realization; indefinite
      - form: "Ally's new car"
        note: Genitive NP realizing determiner function
      - form: "what size hat"
        note: Plain NP determiner in interrogatives
      - form: "over 20 times"
        note: PP determiner in a measure NP
constraints:
  - type: syntactic
    description: Determiner is a dependent within NP structure.
  - type: structural
    description: Singular count nominals generally require determination; bare plural and non-count nominals can be determinerless, and a small set of bare singular count frames are licensed (institutional/time/iteration).
