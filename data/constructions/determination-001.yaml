id: determination-001
name: Determination
pattern: "Determiner function in NP"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Licenses a nominal as an NP and marks it for definiteness or indefiniteness
    details: Realized by determinatives, genitive NPs (subject-determiners), and a limited set of plain-case NPs or PPs.
    examples:
      - form: "the new car"
        note: Determinative realization; definite
      - form: "one new car"
        note: Determinative realization; indefinite
      - form: "Ally's new car"
        note: Genitive NP realizing determiner function
      - form: "what size hat"
        note: Plain NP determiner in interrogatives
      - form: "over 20 times"
        note: PP determiner in a measure NP
constraints:
  - type: syntactic
    description: Determiner is a dependent within NP structure.
  - type: structural
    description: Singular count nominals generally require determination; bare plural and mass nominals can be determinerless in some contexts.
