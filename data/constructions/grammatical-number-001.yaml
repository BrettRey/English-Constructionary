id: grammatical-number-001
name: Grammatical Number
pattern: Applies to nouns and agreement targets
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Specifies cardinality features
    details: Core semantic features relating to quantity/cardinality of referents
    examples:
      - form: cat/cats
        note: Singular vs non-singular reference
      - form: this/these
        note: Singular vs non-singular determination
    relations:
      - 1
  '2':
    definition: Marks countability status
    details: Indicates whether referents are construed as countable units
    examples:
      - form: rice/rices
        note: Mass vs count construal
    relations:
      - 2
