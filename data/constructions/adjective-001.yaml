name: Adjective
pattern: Adj root
type: syntactic
dimensions:
  form: "Lexical stem; accepts degree morphology (-er/-est) or degree modifiers (very)"
  meaning: "Scalar, classificatory, state, evaluative, or referential feature bundles"
  function: "Modifier of nominal; predicative complement; rarely argument"
  distribution: "Attributive (prenominal), predicative, postpositive; some restricted to one position"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Denotes scalar feature bundle
    details: Core semantic features that position entities on measurable dimensions

  '2':
    definition: Denotes classificatory feature bundle
    details: Semantic features that assign entities to categories or types
