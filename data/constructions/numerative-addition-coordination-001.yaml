id: numerative-addition-coordination-001
name: Numerative Addition Coordination (with and)
pattern: "[DP magnitude] + and + [DP addition]"
type: syntactic
dimensions:
  form: "Coordination with overt 'and' marker; right-branching"
  meaning: "Additive composition of magnitude and addition"
  function: "Builds complex numeratives recursively"
  distribution: "Preferred in BrE; more formal registers"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Additive numerative formed by coordinating magnitude units and additions
    examples:
      - form: two hundred and five
        note: 200 + 5
      - form: two thousand and seven
        note: 2000 + 7
constraints:
  - type: structural
    description: Coordination targets numerative constituents; additions are coordinated DPs.
  - type: structural
    description: "Recursive: the addition DP can itself be a basic numerative or a magnitude phrase."
