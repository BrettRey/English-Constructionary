id: numerative-ordinal-rightmost-001
name: Rightmost-base Ordinal Formation in Numeratives
pattern: "[numerative] + ordinal suffix on rightmost simple base"
type: morphological
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Ordinal morphology targets the rightmost simple base within a numerative
    examples:
      - form: twenty-fourth
        note: Ordinal suffix on rightmost base (four)
      - form: two hundredth
        note: Ordinal suffix on magnitude base (hundred)
      - form: twenty-second
        note: Suppletive ordinal on rightmost base (two → second)
constraints:
  - type: structural
    description: Ordinal/fractional morphology selects the rightmost simple base in the numerative constituent.
  - type: morphological
    description: Irregular bases (first/second/third) are lexically specified.
