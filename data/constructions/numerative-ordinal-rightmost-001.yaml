id: numerative-ordinal-rightmost-001
name: Rightmost-base Ordinal Formation in Numeratives
pattern: "[numerative] + ordinal suffix on rightmost simple base"
type: morphological
dimensions:
  form: "Complex numerative with ordinal morphology on rightmost base only"
  meaning: "Ordinal meaning applies to entire numerative"
  function: "Morphological targeting rule for ordinal/fractional formation"
  distribution: "Defines constituent boundary before noun; key evidence against cascading NumP"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Ordinal morphology targets the rightmost simple base within a numerative
    examples:
      - form: twenty-fourth
        note: Ordinal suffix on rightmost base (four)
      - form: two hundredth
        note: Ordinal suffix on magnitude base (hundred)
      - form: twenty-second
        note: Suppletive ordinal on rightmost base (two → second)
constraints:
  - type: structural
    description: Ordinal/fractional morphology selects the rightmost simple base in the numerative constituent.
  - type: morphological
    description: Irregular bases (first/second/third) are lexically specified.
