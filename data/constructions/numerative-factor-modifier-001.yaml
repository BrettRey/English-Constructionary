id: numerative-factor-modifier-001
name: Factor + Magnitude Numerative
pattern: "Det[factor] + Det[magnitude]"
type: syntactic
dimensions:
  form: "Basic numerative (0-99) + magnitude; factor is modifier, not determiner"
  meaning: "Multiplicative composition (factor × magnitude)"
  function: "Factor scales magnitude head; near-obligatory in most contexts"
  distribution: "Factor precedes magnitude head; prosodic break after magnitude"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Multiplicative numerative built by combining a factor with a magnitude head
    examples:
      - form: two hundred
        note: 2 × 100
      - form: forty-two million
        note: 42 × 1,000,000
constraints:
  - type: structural
    description: Factor is a modifier of the magnitude head, not a determiner of the NP.
  - type: structural
    description: Factor is drawn from the basic numeratives (0–99).
