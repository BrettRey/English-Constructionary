meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Denotes relative scale position
    details: Semantic features encoding comparative, superlative and equative scale relations
    examples:
      - form: taller/shorter than; more/less expensive than
        note: Bidirectional comparison
      - form: tallest/shortest; most/least expensive
        note: Scale endpoints
      - form: as tall as
        note: Scale equality
  '2':
    definition: Denotes scale intervals
    details: Semantic features encoding degree of difference between scale points
    examples:
      - form: much taller/slightly shorter
        note: Relative intervals
      - form: two feet taller/three times less
        note: Measured intervals
  '3':
    definition: Denotes comparison classes
    details: Semantic features encoding reference sets for comparison
    examples:
      - form: taller than average/most expensive of all
        note: Set comparison
      - form: as tall as expected/least expensive option
        note: Standard comparison
