   examples:
     - form: "taller/shorter than; more/less expensive than"
       note: "Bidirectional comparison"
     - form: "tallest/shortest; most/least expensive"
       note: "Scale endpoints"

   definition: "Denotes scale intervals"
   details: "Semantic features encoding degree of difference between scale points"
   examples:
     - form: "much taller/slightly shorter"
       note: "Relative intervals"
     - form: "two feet taller/three times less"

   definition: "Denotes comparison classes"
   details: "Semantic features encoding reference sets for comparison"
   examples:
     - form: "taller than average/most expensive of all"
       note: "Set comparison"
     - form: "as tall as expected/least expensive option"
       note: "Standard comparison"
