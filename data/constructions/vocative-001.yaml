id: vocative-001
name: Vocative Construction
pattern: NP[vocative]
type: syntactic
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Addresses the hearer directly, identifying them as the intended recipient
    details: Forms its own intonation phrase, typically with fall-rise or level contour; summons use may have high sustained "calling" contour. Not syntactically integrated as a clause argument. NP is either bare or determined by 1st/2nd person forms only (genitive my/our/your, or determinative you).
    examples:
      - form: "[Mom], can you help me?"
        note: Bare kinship term, clause-initial
      - form: "I think, [Brett], you're wrong."
        note: Bare proper name, clause-medial
      - form: "[Moooom]!"
        note: Summons with calling contour (high sustained pitch)
      - form: "[Ladies and gentlemen], welcome."
        note: Bare coordinated NPs, formulaic
      - form: "[My friend], let me explain."
        note: 1st-person genitive determiner
      - form: "[Our Father], who art in heaven..."
        note: 1st-person plural genitive
      - form: "[Your majesty], we request an audience."
        note: 2nd-person genitive, honorific
      - form: "[You idiot], watch out!"
        note: 2nd-person personal determinative
constraints:
  - type: syntactic
    description: NP is bare or determined only by 1st/2nd person forms (my, our, your, you); 3rd-person and non-deictic determiners excluded
  - type: pragmatic
    description: Requires addressee to be present (real or imagined)
  - type: structural
    description: Forms separate intonation phrase with fall-rise, level, or calling contour
  - type: position
    description: Can occur clause-initially, clause-medially, or clause-finally
relations:
  '1':
    construction: np-bare-001
    type: related-to
    notes: Vocatives strongly favour bare NPs, especially for proper names and kinship terms
  '2':
    construction: np-proper-001
    type: related-to
    notes: Proper names are prototypical vocatives
relatedConstructions:
  - id: np-bare-001
    relationship: interfaces-with
    notes: Vocative function licenses bare NP for kinship terms that would otherwise require determination
  - id: np-proper-001
    relationship: interfaces-with
    notes: Proper names freely occur as vocatives
