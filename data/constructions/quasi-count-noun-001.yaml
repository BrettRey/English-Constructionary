id: quasi-count-noun-001
name: Quasi-count Plural Noun
pattern: "N[plural-only quasi-count]"
meanings:
  '1':
    definition: Denotes aggregates of discrete individuals with weakened individuation, yielding a mixed countability profile
    examples:
      - form: many cattle
        note: Loose count property
      - form: "*a cattle"
        note: Tight property rejected
      - form: three head of cattle
        note: Specialized singulative counting frame
constraints:
  - type: syntactic
    description: Plural-only morphology with plural agreement; resists singular and a/an.
  - type: semantic
    description: Individuation is weakened; tight count properties (low cardinals, distributives) are degraded.
  - type: pragmatic
    description: Tight cardinality uses surface mainly in specialized registers.

  stabilisers:
    - type: entrenchment
      evidence: "High-frequency quasi-count lexemes stabilize the profile."
    - type: functional-pressure
      evidence: "Singulative reference is offloaded to functional alternatives (cow, officer)."
    - type: transmission
      evidence: "Iterated transmission preserves the ordered dissociation pattern."
  projectibility:
    scope: "New aggregate nouns align with loose diagnostics before tight ones."
    evidence: "Quasi-count class shows implicational hierarchy."
    confidence: medium

    perturbations:
      - "Loss of functional singulatives pushes toward full count or non-count profiles."
