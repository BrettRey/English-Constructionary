# Constructionary Browser

## Run locally
1. From the repo root:
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```
2. Open the URL printed in the terminal (defaults to `http://localhost:8000/web/`).

If you only want to rebuild the manifest without starting a server:
```bash
npm run build:web
```

The browser reads YAML/MD/TEX/PDF files directly from the repo via HTTP.
