## 2026-02-01: Peircean triad for construction schema?

**Sparked by:** mereology paper's expression-shape / operator / payload triad

**Question:** Would the Constructionary benefit from a Peircean triadic model rather than Saussurean dyad (form + meaning)?

**Tentative mapping:**
- Expression-shape → Representamen (the vehicle)
- Payload → Object (what's communicated)
- Operator → Interpretant (conventional mediation)

**Implication:** If operators *are* constructions, then the Constructionary documents the middle term - what makes a given form-payload pairing systematic rather than ad hoc.

**Reframe:** The `meaning` field isn't "what the form means" but "what interpretive operation the form conventionally licenses."

**Open questions:**
1. Does this clarify or just relabel?
2. Would schema changes follow, or just documentation?
3. Which Peircean interpretant type (immediate/dynamic/final) fits best?

**Next step:** Consider drafting a revision to `docs/SCHEMA.md` that tries on the triadic framing.
